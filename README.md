## Hi There!

I'm Shiva, I'm currently a final year MEng Computer Science student at Imperial College London.
I'm passionate about programming languages, especially verification and semantics. I also love functional programming and am interested in type theory.

I've previously had multiple internships, including at [Palantir](https://www.palantir.com/), where I was a forward deployed engineer, building out optimisation models for clients across various sectors.

I care deeply about the tools that I use (I <3 Emacs and Org mode especially) and you can checkout my dotfiles [here](https://github.com/shiva-tk/dots).
