## Hi There!

I'm Shiva, I'm a final year MEng Computing student at Imperial College London.
I'm passionate about programming languages, especially verification and semantics. In addition, I love functional programming and I am interested in type theory.

At the moment, I'm working on my final year project, which is related to [Gillian](https://gillianplatform.github.io/sphinx/index.html), a multi-language analysis platform supporting verification and symbolic testing.

I've previously worked at [Palantir](https://www.palantir.com/), where I was a forward deployed engineer, building out optimisation models for clients across various sectors.

I care deeply about the tools that I use (I <3 Emacs and Org mode especially) and you can checkout my dotfiles [here](https://github.com/shiva-tk/dots) (warning they are very WIP).
